	<h1>Auto Nut Driver Reduces Injuries</h1>
	<div style="float:right;margin:10px;"><img src="/images/NUT DRIVING SYSTEM.jpg" /></div>                
	<p>Design Tool was approached by a leading transportation-industry manufacturer to alleviate repetitive motion injuries caused by workers manually installing hex flange nuts on their assembly.
	<p>DTI’s solution was a simple, bench-mounted, automatic nut feeding and driving system, complete with part fixturing, a bulk nut supply hopper and all controls.  This system automatically fastens a nut in 1.4 seconds.
	<p>The cost of one worker’s injury from manually assembling the parts was much more than the cost of the turnkey system provided by DTI.
	<p>An additional benefit was a nearly 100% increase in part production.  According to the customer, previous assembly times were 7 seconds when done by hand.  The DTI solution results in a part produced about every 3 seconds.
