			Tool Inc. is a worldwide leader in automatic screwdriving technology. 
			Our DTI team has a combined 85 years of experience in the design 
			and manufacturing of automatic assembly equipment. Design Tool 
			Inc. is a North Carolina-based company that provides automatic 
			screwdriving solutions to a wide scope of industries such as 
			automotive, electronics, metal, plastics, telecommunications, 
			wood and many others. DTI has over 5,000 machines that operate 
			in over 10 countries around the world. Our network includes 
			50 distributors and reps that sell and service our equipment 
			and ensure the customer's satisfaction.<br />
			<br />
			Design Tool is a leader in the industry because of its five 
			patents on its feed mechanism. Our patented feed mechanism has 
			only one moving part. The twist-lock cover permits fast access 
			to the feed mechanism allowing it to be disassembled and reassembled 
			in seconds without the use of tools. Our patented multifeed 
			system allows us to feed up to 10 multispindle screwdrivers 
			from one hopper.<br />
			<br />
			The DTI Model 5000 is the world's simplest automatic screwfeeder 
			on the market that is built for durability and reliability of 
			performance during production. You can never afford to be down 
			during manufacturing time. Design tool prides itself for keeping 
			replacement parts in inventory at the factory or distributor 
			locations. Many parts are standard commercial parts and are 
			available at your local maintenance supply house.<br />
			<br />
			Design Tool also builds multispindle screwdriving systems that 
			are custom-designed as a turnkey system or supplied as components. 
			We also design XYZ, computerized, and PLC controlled units. 
			Our accessories include shrouds, supply hoppers and work arms.<br />
			<br />
			So just remember our slogan &quot;Just Add Screws&quot; and 
			our name.
