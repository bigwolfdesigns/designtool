			<p><h1>Fixtured Components for Machine Builders / Integrators</h1>

			<p>Integrators and machine builders that face screw feeding as one of their requirements in a project and do not want to handle that portion of the system can turn to DTI for a solution.  The DTI Fixtured Automatic Feed Componentry can easily be integrated into your overall system to attack the screw feeding needs involved in the assembly process.  DTI Fixtured Automatic Feed Componentry provides a great fit for integrators and machine builders with its screwdriver platens, multi-exit feeder bowls and supply hoppers.

			<p>Our 

				bowl feeder systems are designed for loading automatic / pneumatic 

				fastening systems.</p>
