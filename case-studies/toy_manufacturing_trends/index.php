	<p style="font-weight:bold;"> What are the biggest assembly/joining challenge affecting toy manufacturers today? </p>
	<p>The biggest assembly challenge affecting toy manufacturers today is cost vs. assembly method. &nbsp;Toys are typically lower cost products, and must be assembled efficiently for the least amount of labor and cost.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p style="font-weight:bold;"> What types of joining processes and equipment are toy manufacturers looking for today?</p>
	<p>Toy manufacturers are using mechanical fit (interlocking parts), adhesives, and screws to fasten toys together. &nbsp;Plastic welding is also used in certain types of designs.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p style="font-weight:bold;"> What are the advantages of using screws for toy assembly?</p>
	<p>Screws offer several advantages for toy assembly. &nbsp;The most obvious advantage to using screws is ease of disassembly in the case of a defect or mistake in the assembly process. &nbsp;Other joining processes such as adhesives, plastic welding, or interlocking fits are much more difficult to disassemble in the event of a defect, leading to higher scrap rates. &nbsp;Screw fasteners also enhance the use of automated equipment in the assembly process. &nbsp;Design Tool Inc. offers both handheld auto feed screwdriving systems or full CNC screwdriving equipment to assemble the product. &nbsp;DTI also offers auto feed components such as bowl feeders and platen assemblies that can be used by machine builders to build custom assembly equipment for the toy industry. &nbsp;The use of screws also contributes to a more robust design, as the fastening process can be controlled and quantified, confirming joint integrity without destructive testing. DC electric screwdrivers can be used for reporting torque and angle configurations.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p style="font-weight:bold;"> What types of toys typically rely most heavily on screwdriving?</p>
	<p>Toys with electrical or mechanical motion components tend to rely most heavily upon screws to fasten the components. &nbsp;As design complexity increases, the use of screws seems to increase also.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p style="font-weight:bold;"> What types of screws tend to be the most popular with toy manufacturers?</p>
	<p>Self-tapping screw designs such as Plastite thread forms tend to be the most popular with toy manufacturers.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p style="font-weight:bold;"> What types of screwdriving tools are the most widely used for toy assembly applications?</p>
	<p>In terms of automation, hand held auto feed screwdriving systems are the most widely used for toy assembly applications. &nbsp;Robotic systems and XY Cartesian systems are used less frequently due to the higher initial cost of these types of systems.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p style="font-weight:bold;"> Are plastic parts used in the toy industry becoming more complex today (e.g., shapes and sizes)? Can you give me any generic examples? What challenges does this put on assembly?</p>
	<p>As the use of CAD software has become more prevalent throughout the toy industry, the shapes of the plastic parts have become more complex. &nbsp;For example, toys that transform from one shape to another by moving components into different positions have very complex shapes. &nbsp;As parts become more complex, access to the fasteners themselves becomes more challenging. &nbsp;A fastener may be located in an area that has minimal clearance around the head of the screw, making automation very difficult. &nbsp;Also, fasteners are often located in deep recesses that limit screw access as well.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p style="font-weight:bold;"> Is screw sizes used in toys becoming smaller today? How is that affecting assembly?</p>
	<p>Screw sizes used in toys are becoming smaller today, as joint analysis and cost drive the manufacturer toward using the smallest fastener that will achieve the desired joint integrity. &nbsp;Smaller screws are often more difficult to automate, as the clearance area around smaller screws is usually more restrictive, leading to problems with access on automated systems. &nbsp;Smaller screws can also be more difficult to feed as well. &nbsp;Design Tool, Inc. has a patented feed mechanism that works very well with small screw designs.</p>
